![images_community/download/attachments/83492948/db2-large.png](images_community/download/attachments/83492948/db2-large.png)  

The DB2 plugin enables monitoring behavior metrics provided in a DB2 database.The plugin uses JDBC to connect to the DB2 Database and queries key performance metrics. Having these measures in
dynaTrace enables quick correlation of database related performance issues such as high I/O or too many database connections to application transaction performance problems such as long running
transactions or slow database queries.

Since this plugin is currently in BETA, please follow the best practice of having a separate collector for your monitoring plugins.
